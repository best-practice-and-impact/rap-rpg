Play this game to find out about collaborative coding best practice!

RAP-RPG is a text-based role playing game. Roll a dice to decide how our publishing team will approach the production of their statistic. Will they be able to publish on time and without errors? Let's find out, and learn about good collaborative and coding practices along the way.

This game remains a demo for the time being - so let us know any bugs you find!

## How to play
Grab a 6 sided dice, or use a [virtual dice roller](https://share.google/0h7RJgkUX3a1l9D5O).

Clone the repo with `git clone https://github.com/best-practice-and-impact/rap-rpg.git`

On a terminal or command line interface, head to the repo folder, and simply use Python to play! `python play_rap_rpg.py`. 

Or, load up `play_game.py` in your code editor of choice, and play in the terminal there!

Enjoy! ðŸ¥³
